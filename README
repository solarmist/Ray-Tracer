This is a simple ray tracer to learn the basics of ray tracing.

It is based on the Ray Tracer oulined in Peter Shirley's book. I've made changes here and there where I've found something interesting to enhance.

The goal is to evenually port this to Objective-C and add OpenCL and multicore support.
